## Contributing guidelines
Contributers must sign the CLA. The CLA bot will post instructions to new contributors when their first PR is opened as a comment. To agree to the CLA, respond:

> [@microsoft-github-policy-service agree](https://github.com/microsoft/contributorlicenseagreement#accepting)

If you have previously agreed to the CLA but the check is failing/not running, try rerunning with:

> @microsoft-github-policy-service rerun
